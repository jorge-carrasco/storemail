# The configs in this file will overwrite the configs that are defined in a corresponding Dockerfile.
# So some of these configs might not be necessary if they are already defined in a correspoding Dockerfile.
# In fact, some of the configs in this file might throw errors, but they won't throw errors in the Dockerfile.
# See the `docker-compose.dev.yml` file for an example of this.
